            <h3>Uses Google Calandar to trigger music playback on a set of speakers via a Raspberry Pi.</h3>
            <p>An ancient project, one of the very first published on the blog. Used a freshly released Raspberry Pi to prevent myself from sleeping in. This post was featured on lifehacker.com, a major technology publication at the time. The thrilling rush of comments, and feedback that resulted from this post is probably what lead to me continuning to publish my work in this way for so long. Little did I know at the time, but both the Raspberry Pi and Python would remain a major part of my life for years to come. It&#39;s probably innapropriate to include an 10 year old project in a portfolio like this but this work will always have a place in my heart.</p>
