description: Artwork and music video for Won Pound album.
domain: software
explanation: Client wanted accompanying visuals for an album themeatically focused
  on self-reflection. Worked with client to capture over 50,000 images to then train
  a [StyleGAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StyleGAN) network. Then, created [GANce](https://www.esologic.com/gance/)
  framework to input music and create animations. Won Pound by Won Pound was released
  via [Minaret Records](https://www.minaretrecords.com).
