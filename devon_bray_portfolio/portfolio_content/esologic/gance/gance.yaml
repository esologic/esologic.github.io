description: Tool to map music and video into the latent space of StyleGAN2 networks.
domain: software
explanation: GANce (pronounced like dance) is a framework for piping music and video
  into StyleGAN networks. Resulting music video is a collaboration with [Won Pound](https://wonpound.bandcamp.com/)
  for his forthcoming album release (April 2022) via [minaret records](https://minaretrecords.bandcamp.com/artists).
  Created the camera used to capture training images, then trained [StyleGAN2](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2)
  networks. Note that this tool is an active work in progress.
