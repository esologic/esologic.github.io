description: Tool to map music and video into the latent space of StyleGAN2 networks.
domain: software
explanation: GANce (pronounced like dance) is a python framework for piping music
  and video into custom-trained StyleGAN networks. Results are music-mapped GAN animations.
  Also created the camera used to capture training images, then trained [StyleGAN2](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2)
  networks.
