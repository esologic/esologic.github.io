description: System for measuring how people watch TV.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: US Patent No. US11540009B2 encapsulates much of the work I have done
  at TVision since starting there in 2018. I am included on this patent alongside
  the CTO, the director of Engineering, Head of Data Science and Vice President of
  Product Management. To summarize, the patent describes the device we deploy in our
  panelists homes. This device uses a camera, microphone, and local network analysis
  to determine who is in the room, what is being played on the TV, and if they're
  paying attention. I was key contributor to the Packet Inspection component of this
  patent (module 1702), but have worked on all of the different software components
  running on our devices.
