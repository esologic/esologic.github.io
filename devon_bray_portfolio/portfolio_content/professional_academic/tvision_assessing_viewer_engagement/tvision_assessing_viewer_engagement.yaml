description: System for measuring how people actually watch TV.
domain: mixed (hardware, software)
explanation: >-
  US Patent No. US11540009B2 describes my largest contribution to TVision since
  starting there in 2018. The inventors listed on this patent are: the CTO, the Director
  of
  Engineering, Head of Data Science and Vice President of
  Product Management and myself. To summarize, the patent describes the device we
  deploy in our
  panelists homes. This device uses a camera, microphone, and local network analysis
  to determine who is in the room, what is being played on the TV, and if the viewer
  is
  paying attention. I was the lead designer of the Packet Inspection component of
  this
  patent (module 1702), but have worked on all of the different software components
  running on our devices.
